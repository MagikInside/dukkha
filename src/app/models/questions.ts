The streets are lined with colorful stalls and vendors hawking their goods, and the air is filled with the sounds of haggling and the smells of cooking food. The market is a hub of activity and commerce, but it's also a prime location for thieves and pickpockets.

      {name: "The Slums", description: "The Slums District is the poorest and most rundown part of the village, located at the southeast. It's a collection of small shacks and hovels, built haphazardly and in poor repair. The streets are narrow, dirty, and often flooded when it rains. The district is home to the village's most destitute and marginalized residents, including beggars, outcasts, and criminals. The area is neglected by the village's leaders, and the residents here often have to rely on themselves for survival. The district is a hotbed of crime and vice, and is avoided by most of the villagers. The Red Brands rarely patrol this area and the people living there are left to their own devices. It's a place where people with no other options go, and it's a place of poverty and danger."},

It is home to the wealthiest and most powerful residents of the village, including the mayor and other members of the village council.

Inside, there is a large central altar where the priests and priestesses perform ceremonies and offerings to the gods. The temple is also home to a library where the holy texts and teachings of the gods are kept."},
